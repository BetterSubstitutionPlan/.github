## How this Project started

Starting in feburary 2021 [minie4](https://github.com/minie4) and [ueberflieger](https://github.com/ueberflieger50/) started working on an application to improve our expicence with our schools substitution plan.

In the beginning the Project was called "RGBVertretungsplan", later we changed it to its current name. We stared building all the required components for this app but never really built the actuall app.

## What this Organization contains

Within this Org you can find the [UntisParser](https://github.com/BetterSubstitutionPlan/UntisParser) and the [DSBDownloader](https://github.com/BetterSubstitutionPlan/DSBDownloader).  
These are used to get and evaluate Substitutionplans exported by Untis and hostet by DSBmobile. Both tools are very minimal in usage and footprint.

## More resources and current evolvements of the Idea

After we never really started to work on this Projekt the both of us started to do spinoffs on our own.

> Der RGPlan ist eine Anwendung zur übersichtlicheren Darstellung des Vertretungsplanes des Rückert-Gymnasiums.  
> Hauptfunktionen sind bspw. das Filtern des Vertretungsplanes, um nur eine bestimme Klasse anzuzeigen. Außerdem werden die Vertretungen sortiert und in einer ansprechenderen Form dargestellt.  
> Ebenso fasst der RGPlan drei verschieden Dinge in eine Anwendung zusammen: den Vertretungsplan, Cafeteria Plan und einen Stundenplan.

> This Tool queries and parses the latest substitution-plan data every minute. The correctness of the data can in no way be guaranteed, so please check the data against the official plan if something seems wrong! Due to the format of the plan files, it it sometimes not easily possible to extract the correct data, so the plan displayed here may not be correct.
